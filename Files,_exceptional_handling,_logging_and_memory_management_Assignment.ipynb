        "\n",
        "1. The entire source code is translated (compiled) into machine code before execution is known as Compiled Language. It produces a binary/executable file that can be run directly. It is faster since the code is already compiled. All errors are detected during compilation (before running).\n",
        "It is specific to one platform (machine-dependent).\n",
        "\n",
        "   The source code is translated and executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime is known as Interpreted Language.\n",
        "   It does not produce a separate executable file runs the code each time. It is slower since translation happens during execution. Errors appear one by one during execution. It is more portable (as long as an interpreter exists for that platform).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Exception handling is a mechanism that allows us to handle runtime errors in our program so that it does'nt crash abruptly.It helps to detect, respond , and recover from unexpected events or errors that occur while the program is running.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Finally block is always executed,even if we enter exception block or not, finally will be executed always, similar to running other line of code. This is the purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. The process of recording messages that describe what our program is doing while it runs , especially useful for debugging, monitoring, and error tracking is known as Logging.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. The __del__ method  is a destructor that automatically describes  an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Using import- When we use import, we bring the entire module into our program. We must use the module name to access its functions or variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Using from ... import- When we use from ... import, we import specific items (functions, classes, or variables) directly from a module. We can use them without the module name prefix.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. To handle Multiple Exceptions, the steps are as follows:-\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Handling Multiple Exceptions Separately- We can use multiple except blocks, one for each exception type.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Handling Multiple Exceptions Together- If we want to handle different exceptions the same way, we can group them in a tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Catching the Exception Object- We can also access the error message by assigning the exception to a variable using as.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Using a Generic Exception- We can catch any exception using Exception, though this should be used carefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. The with statement  is used to manage resources automatically, especially when working with files. The main purpose is to simplify file handling by automatically closing the file after its block of code is executed ,even if an error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Multithreading uses multiple threads (lightweight execution units) within a single process. All threads share the same memory space. It is useful for I/O-bound tasks (like reading files, waiting for network responses, or user input).\n",
        "  \n",
        "   Multiprocessing uses multiple processes, each with its own memory space and Python interpreter. It is ideal for CPU-bound tasks (like heavy calculations or data processing) because each process can run in parallel on different CPU cores.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. The advantages of using logging in program are as follows:-\n",
        "\n",
        "    Helps in Debugging and Troubleshooting- Logging records detailed information about program execution, errors, and events. When something goes wrong, logs helps us to trace the cause without rerunning the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Provides Persistent Records- Logs can be saved to files, so even after our program ends, we have a record of what happened. This is essential for auditing, testing, and analyzing user behavior in production systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Easier Maintenance- Logs give developers insight into how the system behaves over time. It helps in identifying recurring issues and improving system reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Flexible and Configurable- The logging module lets us to control what level of messages to record (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), where o send them (console, file, network, etc.) and how they are formatted (timestamps, module names, line numbers, etc.).\n",
        "     \n",
        "    Better than print()\n",
        "\n",
        "    Supports Different Severity Levels- We can classify and filter messages by importance:\n",
        "\n",
        "    DEBUG → Detailed info (for developers)\n",
        "    \n",
        "    INFO → General runtime events\n",
        "\n",
        "    WARNING → Something unexpected, but still running\n",
        "\n",
        "    ERROR → A serious problem\n",
        "\n",
        "    CRITICAL → System failure\n",
        "\n",
        "    This makes it easier to focus only on relevant messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Useful for Long-Running or Distributed Systems- Logs provide visibility into what’s happening across multiple components or servers. Essential for diagnosing issues in production environments where direct debugging isn’t possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. Memory management in  refers to the process by which Python allocates, manages, and frees memory automatically while our program runs , so we don't have to manually handle memory like in C or C++. It is designed to make coding easier and safer by handling memory efficiently in the background.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. The basic steps involved in exception handling are as follows:-\n",
        "   \n",
        "    Use a try block- Place the code that might raise an exception inside a try block. Python will “try” to execute this code.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Add an except block- If an exception occurs in the try block, Python jumps to the except block. We an handle specific exceptions or use a general one.\n",
        "\n",
        "    (Optional) Use an else block- The else block runs only if no exception occurs in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "    (Optional) Use a finally block- The finally block always executes — whether an exception occurred or not. It is commonly used for cleanup actions (like closing files or releasing resources).\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Memory management is important because it ensures that our program uses the computer's memory efficiently, preventing crashes, slow performance, or memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. The \"try\" and \"except\" blocks are the core components of exception handling.They help us to manage and respond to errors gracefully ,without crashing our program.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. Python's garbage collection (GC) system automatically manages memory by identifying and freeing objects that are no longer needed, so we don't have to do it manually.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. The \"else\" block in exception handling is used to define code that should run only if no exceptions occur in the \"try\" block. It helps to seperate error free logic from error handling logic making our code cleaner and easier to read.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. The Common Logging Levels in Python are as follows:-\n",
        "\n",
        "    DEBUG (10): Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "    INFO (20): Confirmation that things are working as expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "    WARNING (30): An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (eg 'disk space low'). The software is still working as expected. This is the default logging level if no explicit configuration is provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "    ERROR (40): Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.\n",
        "\n",
        "    CRITICAL (50): A severe error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. os.fork()- A low-level function (available only on Unix/Linux systems), creates a child process by duplicating the current (parent) process and the new process starts execution right after the fork point.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Multiprocessing- A high-level, cross-platform (works on Windows, macOS, Linux) module, simplifies process creation and communication using the Process class and automatically handles data sharing, queues, pipes, and synchronization between processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. The importance of closing a file ensures that system resources are properly released and that all data written to the file is saved correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. file.read()- Reads the entire file content (or a specified number of bytes/characters) at once and returns the data as a single string.\n",
        "\n",
        "    file.readline()- Reads one line at a time from the file and each call to readline() reads the next line, including the newline character (\\n).\n",
        "\n",
        "21. The logging module is used to record (log) messages that describe what's happening in a program, especially useful for debugging, monitoring, and error tracking. It provides a flexible way to track events while the program runs, without using print statements everywhere.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. The os module is used to interact with the operating system, and in the context of file handling, it provides powerful tools to work with files and directories, beyond just opening or reading files. It allows our Python program to create, rename, move, delete, and inspect files and folders directly at the operating-system level.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. The challenges associated with memory management in Python are as follows:-\n",
        "    \n",
        "    High Memory Usage: Python objects often have a higher memory footprint compared to objects in lower-level languages like C or C++. This can lead to applications consuming more RAM than expected, especially when dealing with large datasets or long-running processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Garbage Collection Overhead: While Python's automatic garbage collection simplifies development, it can introduce performance overhead. Frequent or complex garbage collection cycles can slow down application execution, particularly when memory usage is high or reference cycles are present.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Circular References: Python's primary garbage collection mechanism, reference counting, cannot detect and collect objects involved in circular references (where objects directly or indirectly refer to each other in a closed loop). This can lead to memory leaks if not addressed by the generational garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Fragmentation: Memory fragmentation can occur when memory is allocated and deallocated in non-contiguous blocks, leaving small, unusable gaps. This can reduce the efficiency of memory allocation and potentially prevent the allocation of larger contiguous blocks, even if sufficient total memory is available.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): In CPython, the GIL ensures that only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time. While this simplifies memory management in multi-threaded environments by preventing race conditions on shared memory, it can limit the benefits of multi-threading for CPU-bound tasks, as true parallel execution of Python code is not achieved.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Limited Manual Control: Python's automatic memory management reduces the need for manual memory handling but also offers less fine-grained control compared to languages with explicit memory management. This can make it challenging to optimize memory usage in highly performance-critical scenarios without resorting to lower-level extensions or careful design choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. I can raise an exception manually using the \"raise\" statement. This is useful when I want to signal an error condition or enforce rules in my code.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Multithreading is important in certain applications because when our program performs I/O-bound or concurrent tasks, it helps to  keep the program fast, efficient, and responsive, even while waiting for input/output operations.\n",
